    "## Important Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important that you follow the instructions below to the letter - we will not be responsible for incorrect marking due to non-standard practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color='red'>We have split Assignment 3 into two parts to make it easier for you to work on them separately and for the markers to give you feedback. This is part A of Assignment 3 - Part B is the Mini-Challenge. Both Assignments together are still worth 50% of CourseWork 2. **Remember to submit both notebooks (you can submit them separately).**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You *MUST* have your environment set up as in the [README](https://github.com/michael-camilleri/IAML2018) and you *must activate this environment before running this notebook*:\n",
    "```\n",
    "source activate py3iaml\n",
    "cd [DIRECTORY CONTAINING GIT REPOSITORY]\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "# Navigate to this file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the instructions carefully, especially where asked to name variables with a specific name. Wherever you are required to produce code you should use code cells, otherwise you should use markdown cells to report results and explain answers. In most cases we indicate the nature of answer we are expecting (code/text), and also provide the code/markdown cell where to put it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are some questions which are **specific to those taking the Level-11 version** of the course (INFR11182 and INFR11152). These are clearly marked with the words **(LEVEL 11)** and must be completed by those taking the Level 11 course. Those on the Level 10 version (INFR10069) may (and are advised to) attempt such questions but this will not affect their mark in any way, nor will they get feedback on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The .csv files that you will be using are located at `./datasets` (i.e. use the `datasets` directory **adjacent** to this file).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Keep your answers brief and concise. Most written questions can be answered with 2-3 lines of explanation: **in questions where this is specified, you will be penalised if you go over.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to distinguish between **attributes** (columns of the data) and **features** (typically referring only to the independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to show **all** your code/working. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write readable code. While we do not expect you to follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) to the letter, the code should be adequately understandable, with plots/visualisations correctly labelled. **Do** use inline comments when doing something non-standard. When asked to present numerical values, make sure to represent real numbers in the appropriate precision to exemplify your answer. Marks *WILL* be deducted if the marker cannot understand your logic/results.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collaboration:** You may discuss the assignment with your colleagues, provided that the writing that you submit is entirely your own. That is, you must NOT borrow actual text or code from other students. We ask that you provide a list of the people who you've had discussions with (if any). Please refer to the [Academic Misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct) page for what consistutes a breach of the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBMISSION Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT:** You must submit this assignment by **Thursday 15/11/2018 at 16:00**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Late submissions:** The policy stated in the School of Informatics is that normally you will not be allowed to submit coursework late. See the [ITO webpage](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/ito/admin/coursework-projects/late-coursework-extension-requests) for exceptions to this, e.g. in case of serious medical illness or serious personal problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resubmission:** If you submit your file(s) again, the previous submission is **overwritten**. We will mark the version that is in the submission folder at the deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**N.B.**: This Assignment requires submitting **two files (electronically as described below)**:\n",
    " 1. This Jupyter Notebook for Part A, *and*\n",
    " 1. The Jupyter Notebook for Part B\n",
    " \n",
    "All submissions happen electronically. To submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fill out this notebook (as well as Part B), making sure to:\n",
    "   1. save it with **all code/text and visualisations**: markers are NOT expected to run any cells,\n",
    "   1. keep the name of the file **UNCHANGED**, *and*\n",
    "   1. **keeping the same structure**: retain the questions, and avoid adding unnecessary cells unless absolutely necessary, as this makes the job harder for the markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit it using the `submit` functionality. To do this, you must be on a DICE environment. Open a Terminal, and:\n",
    "   1. **On-Campus Students**: navigate to the location of this notebook and execute the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "      ```submit iaml cw2 03_A_ObjectRecognition.ipynb 03_B_MiniChallenge.ipynb```\n",
    "      \n",
    "   1. **Distance Learners:** These instructions also apply to those students who work on their own computer. First you need to copy your work onto DICE (so that you can use the `submit` command). For this, you can use `scp` or `rsync` (you may need to install these yourself). You can copy files to `student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk`, then ssh into it in order to submit. The following is an example. Replace entries in `[square brackets]` with your specific details: i.e. if your student number is for example s1234567, then `[YOUR USERNAME]` becomes `s1234567`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 03_A_ObjectRecognition.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:03_A_ObjectRecognition.ipynb\n",
    "    scp -r [FULL PATH TO 03_B_MiniChallenge.ipynb] [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk:03_B_MiniChallenge.ipynb\n",
    "    ssh [YOUR USERNAME]@student.ssh.inf.ed.ac.uk\n",
    "    ssh student.login\n",
    "    submit iaml cw2 03_A_ObjectRecognition.ipynb 03_B_MiniChallenge.ipynb\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "   What actually happens in the background is that your file is placed in a folder available to markers. If you submit a file with the same name into the same location, **it will *overwrite* your previous submission**. You should receive an automatic email confirmation after submission.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marking Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "The Level 10 and Level 11 points are marked out of different totals, however these are all normalised to 100%. Note that Part A (this notebook) is worth 75% of the total Mark for Assignment 3, while Part B (Mini-Challenge) is worth 25%: *keep this breakdown in mind when planning your work, especially for Part B*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**70-100%** results/answer correct plus extra achievement at understanding or analysis of results. Clear explanations, evidence of creative or deeper thought will contribute to a higher grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**60-69%** results/answer correct or nearly correct and well explained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50-59%** results/answer in right direction but significant errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**40-49%** some evidence that the student has gained some understanding, but not answered the questions\n",
    "properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**0-39%** serious error or slack work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this is not a programming assignment, in questions which involve visualisation of results and/or long cold snippets, some marks may be deducted if the code is not adequately readable."

    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to recognize objects in images of realistic scenes. There are 19 different classes of object e.g. person, dog, cat, car, etc. The dataset derives from several thousands photographs harvested from the web. Each object of a relevant class has been manually annotated with a bounding box. Images can contain none, one or multiple objects of each class. We have prepared a [website](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/2014/assts/asst3/images.html) where you can view the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to detect whether images contain a person or not - a binary classification problem. To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we have preprocessed the dataset. We will use the [Bag of Visual Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision) representation. Each column of the dataset (which is not a label), refers to a 'visual word'. Each image is represented by a 500 dimensional vector that contains the normalized count for each of 500 different visual words present in the respective image (a similar representation is used for the spambase dataset, just for real words). *Note that the normalisation procedure involves dividing the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image*. See the Appendix at the bottom of the notebook for more information. The image data is thus a $N \\times 500$ dimensional matrix where `N` is the number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset has 520 attributes (dimensions). The first attribute (`imgId`) contains the image ID which allows you to associate a data point with an actual image. The next 500 attributes (`dim1`, ..., `dim500`) are a normalized count vector for each visual word: these are the `features` of the data. The last 19 attributes, which follow the pattern `is_[class]` are the class labels -- here 1 means the class is present in the image. In most of the experiments (unless explicitly noted otherwise) you will only need the `is_person` attribute and the 500 dimensional feature vector. **Do not use the additional class indicator attributes as features** unless explicitly told to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: *Throughout the assignment you will be given various versions of the dataset that are relevant\n",
    "to a particular question. Please be careful to use the correct version of the dataset when instructed to do so.\n",
    "If you use the wrong version of the dataset by mistake no marks will be awarded.*"

    "So far we have used default settings for training the logistic regression classifier. Now we want to optimise the hyperparameters of the classifier, namely the regularisation parameter `C`. We will do this through [K-fold cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). You should familiarise yourself with the interpretation of the `C` parameter.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(b)** [Code] Load the datasets `Images_B_Train.csv` and `Images_B_Test.csv` (this ensures everyone is using the same pre-processed data). Again, extract the relevant columns (`dim1` through `dim500` and the `is_person` class) from each dataset, and store into `X_train`/`X_test` and `y_train`/`y_test` variables.<br>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(c)** [Code] Using Cross-Validation on the **Training** set (a 5-fold split should be sufficient: set `shuffle=True` and `random_state=0`), perform a search for the best value of `C` in the range `1e-5` to `1e5` (*Hint: the KFold [split](http://scikit-learn.org/0.19/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.KFold.split) method will come in handy*).

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;**(d)** [Code] Plot the mean and standard-deviation (across folds) of the accuracy as a function of `C`. *Hint: you may find the matplotlib's [errorbar](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.3/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar.html) function useful. Be careful to use the correct scale on the x-axis.* Using the mean values, report the regularisation parameter with the best accuracy (alongside its accuracy): *N.B. Do not pick the optimal value \"by hand\", instead use an appropriate numpy function*.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The Visual words used in this project are based on [Scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). SIFT features are essentially local orientation histograms and capture the properties of small image regions. They possess attractive invariance properties which make them well suited for our task (you can read more about SIFT features in [D.Lowe, IJCV 60(2):91- 110, 2004](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94), but the details don't matter for the purpose of this assignment). Each SIFT feature is a 128 dimensional vector. From each image many SIFT features are extracted, typically > 2500 per image (features are extracted at regular intervals using a 15 pixel grid and at 4 different scales). To obtain visual words a representative subset of all extracted SIFT features from all images is chosen and clustered with k-means using 500 centres (such use of the k-means algorithm will be discussed in detail during the lecture). These 500 cluster centres form our visual words. The representation of a single image is obtained by first assigning each SIFT feature extracted from the image to the appropriate cluster (i.e. we determine the visual word corresponding to each feature by picking the closest cluster centre). We then count the number of features from that image assigned to each cluster (i.e. we determine how often each visual word is present in the image). This results in a 500 dimensional count vector for each image (one dimension for each visual word). The normalized version of this count vector gives the final representation of the image (normalized means that we divide the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image)"
